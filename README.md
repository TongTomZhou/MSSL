**Abstract:**
Multi-stable structures can be reconfigured with fewer, lightweight, and less accurate actuators. This is because the attraction domain in the multi-stable energy landscape provides both reconfiguration guidance and shape accuracy. Additionally, such structures can generate impulsive motion due to structural instability to mimic Venus flytraps and jumping insects. Most multi-stable structures are designed based on the geometric symmetry (bi-stable unit cells), or direct assembling of bi-stable unit cells (multi-stable assembly). Most multi-stable unit cells are planar structures, while spatial linkages can generate complex 3D motion and hold a more promising potential for application. This paper proposes a generalized approach to design a type of multi-stable spatial linkages (MSSLs) with multiple prescriptible configurations, which are structurally compatible, and naturally stable at these states. It reveals that all over-constrained mechanisms can be transformed into multi-stable structures with the same design method. Single-loop bi-stable 4R and tri-stable 6R spatial linkages modules with non-symmetric stable states, which are respectively transformed from Bennett and Bricard linkages, are designed to illustrate the intrinsic superiority over the ordinary methods, and then assembled deliberately into multi-loop linkages for practical aims. Three bi-stable multi-loop assemblies—a reconfigurable tube, a bio-inspired impulsive gripper, and a swimming robot—are experimentally demonstrated. This design method paves the way for morphing platforms with lightweight actuation, high shape accuracy, high stiffness, and prescribed impulsive 3D motion.
